The data set used will be the Kaggle data set Titanic. The first section will focus on data collection and data wrangling. The second section has its focus on EDA. In the third and last section we will study the following classification models and how to optimize them for the dataset: Logistic Regression, LDA, kNN, SVM, XGBoost and lightGBM. The evaluation metric will be the Kaggle score for each model. 3.1 Data collection and cleaning The data was downloaded from Kaggle.com. The data set is made up of two parts. Part 1 is a training set for supervised learning. Part 2 is a test set, where the outcome column has been removed. We will begin by loading the two data files and have a look at the data types of each column: titanic_train &lt;- read_csv(&quot;./titanic_train.csv&quot;) ## Rows: 891 Columns: 12 ## ── Column specification ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## Delimiter: &quot;,&quot; ## chr (5): Name, Sex, Ticket, Cabin, Embarked ## dbl (7): PassengerId, Survived, Pclass, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare ## ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message. titanic_test &lt;- read_csv(&quot;./titanic_test.csv&quot;) ## Rows: 418 Columns: 11 ## ── Column specification ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## Delimiter: &quot;,&quot; ## chr (5): Name, Sex, Ticket, Cabin, Embarked ## dbl (6): PassengerId, Pclass, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare ## ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message. We see that the training data is comprised of 891 observation of 12 features, whereas the test data is comprised of 418 observations of 11 features. We have 5 features coded as charaters: Name, Sex, Ticket, Cabin, Embarked. We have 6 numeric features: PassengerId, Pclass, Age, SibSp. Parch, Fare. Let us first see if we need to deal with missing values: titanic_train %&gt;% select(which(colSums(is.na(.))&gt;0)) %&gt;% summarise_all(~ sum(is.na(.))) ## # A tibble: 1 × 3 ## Age Cabin Embarked ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 177 687 2 We see that most of the cabin data is missing. We will not deal with these for now, but drop the column, when doing the actual modelling later. For embarked we will replace the missing values with the mode. We start by determining the mode: titanic_train %&gt;% group_by(Embarked) %&gt;% count() %&gt;% arrange(desc(n)) ## # A tibble: 4 × 2 ## # Groups: Embarked [4] ## Embarked n ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 S 644 ## 2 C 168 ## 3 Q 77 ## 4 &lt;NA&gt; 2 Then we replace the NAs by “S”: titanic_train &lt;- titanic_train %&gt;% mutate(Embarked = replace(Embarked,is.na(Embarked),&quot;S&quot;)) Next, let’s have a look at the distribution of age: titanic_train %&gt;% count(Age_interval = cut_interval(Age,n=6)) ## # A tibble: 7 × 2 ## Age_interval n ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 [0.42,13.7] 71 ## 2 (13.7,26.9] 248 ## 3 (26.9,40.2] 245 ## 4 (40.2,53.5] 100 ## 5 (53.5,66.7] 43 ## 6 (66.7,80] 7 ## 7 &lt;NA&gt; 177 We get see that Age seems right skewed. To verify this we calculate the skewness using the {moments} package: titanic_train %&gt;% select(Age) %&gt;% filter(!is.na(.)) %&gt;% summarise(Skewness = moments::skewness(.)) ## # A tibble: 1 × 1 ## Skewness ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 0.388 With the right skewed age data we choose to impute the missing values in Age column with the median. titanic_train &lt;- titanic_train %&gt;% mutate(Age = replace(Age,is.na(Age),median(Age,na.rm=TRUE))) With this we conclude the data collection and preparation process and move on to the EDA. 3.2 EDA "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
